# How the extend feature works in the cascade

Sass' Silent Placeholder function works the same as normal CSS extending in the cascade
===

This example here illustrates how that Sass will extend a silent selector in the cascade the same way that a normal selector would. The only difference is that silent placehodlers are not processed into CSS until they are called into a selector that is processed into CSS.

Play with this in SassMeister to see how the processed CSS changes between the different selectors.
