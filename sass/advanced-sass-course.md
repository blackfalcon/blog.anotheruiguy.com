# Advanced Sass - Treehouse course

Now that you know the basics of Sass, it's time to put these new skills to work in the best way possible. Learning the 'best practices' for writing Sass will gain you admiration among your peers.

This is a course I put together and working with the amazing team at Treehouse we created the Advanced Sass curse. If you have covered all the basics of Sass and are looking for more information on advanced topics, this is a great place to start. In this course I cover the following topics and much more:

* Getting started with architectural concepts.
* Digging deeper into Variables, Mixins, Functions, and Placeholders
* Color functions, random generators, strings and introspection
* Digging hard into Sass' directive library
