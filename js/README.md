# JavaScript all the things

So, in this section of the blog I will put in new things regarding JavaScript that I either learned or feel passionate about.

But ... you should pay more attention to [learningjs.anotheruiguy.com](http://learningjs.anotheruiguy.com), if you are interested in the nitty-gritty details about JavaScript things. Less bloggy and more technical manualish.
